# Share Backported

Firefox Nightly 57 will remove (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1388902) the share feature because it was using a non official Social API.
This extension reimplements the feature using the same icon, which opens a modal window.
This extension reimplement the feature with the same previous icon with the various social icons that open a modal or a tab for Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Linkedin social networks.  
Use a modal if the browser support, seems that Firefox 57 doesn't work so open a new tab.
